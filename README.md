# 🎙️ Speech Emotion Recognition Model  

This project is a **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model** that classifies emotions from speech audio files. It processes speech data, extracts relevant features, and uses machine learning to predict emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, etc.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Processes speech audio to detect emotions  
✅ Uses **ML algorithms** for classification  
✅ Includes a **pre-trained model (.pkl)** for quick predictions  
✅ Built with **Python, librosa, scikit-learn, and Streamlit**  

## 📂 Project Structure

│── speech_emotion_model.pkl   # Saved trained model  
│── scaler.pkl   # Scaler for feature normalization  
│── app.py   # Streamlit app for live predictions

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation  
1️⃣ **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-recognition-model.git
cd speech-recognition-model
```
2️⃣ **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**  
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3️⃣ **Install dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4️⃣ **Run the Streamlit app** (if included)  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📊 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Extracts features** (MFCCs, chroma, mel) from speech  
2️⃣ **Normalizes & preprocesses** audio features  
3️⃣ **Trains a classification model** (e.g., SVM, Random Forest)  
4️⃣ **Predicts emotions** from new speech samples  

## 🏗️ Future Improvements  
- Improve accuracy with **deep learning (LSTMs, CNNs)**
- Add **real-time audio processing**
- Optimize **performance & deployment**
